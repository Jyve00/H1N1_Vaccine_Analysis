    "A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find potential factors in vaccine hesistancy in the COVID-19 pandemic, we used a dataset of characteristics of people who either got the H1N1 or didn't. We tested different machine learning models on the dataset for prediction accuracy and ended up choosing a ____ model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of the business problem you are trying to solve, and the data questions that you plan to answer to solve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDC has hired us as data scientists to find lessons from the H1N1 pandemic. Early into the vaccine rollout, there has been massive public skepticism of the vaccine, slowing our ability to overcome the virus and re-open the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have received a large dataset from 2009, with statistical information and pandemic/H1N1 scaled opinions for each respondent. This data includes whether each person was vaccinated or not, which will allow us to predict who gets the vaccine.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will allow the CDC to determine investments in public health awaareness, surveying and modelling during the pandemic, based on the parameters which impact an individuals vaccine choice the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Who are your stakeholders?\n",
    "- What are your stakeholders' pain points related to this project?\n",
    "- Why are your predictions important from a business perspective?\n",
    "- What exactly is your deliverable: your analysis, or the model itself?\n",
    "- Does your business understanding/stakeholder require a specific type of model?\n",
    "    - For example: a highly regulated industry would require a very transparent/simple/interpretable model, whereas a situation where the model itself is your deliverable would likely benefit from a more complex and thus stronger model\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional questions to consider for classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What does a false positive look like in this context?\n",
    "- What does a false negative look like in this context?\n",
    "- Which is worse for your stakeholder?\n",
    "- What metric are you focusing on optimizing, given the answers to the above questions?"

    "\n",
    "The dataset includes 26,000 respondents responses, and includes 34 different characteristics. They provide demographic information such as age, sex, race, income, and education and also include opinion and knowledge assessment on the risk of the H1N1 virus. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable is the 'h1n1 vaccine' column. It is binary: 0 means the respondent didn't get the vaccine and 1 means they did. \n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?\n",
    "- What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?\n",
    "- What is the target variable?\n",
    "- What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?"
